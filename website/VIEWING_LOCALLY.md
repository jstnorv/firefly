# How to View the Website Locally

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `website` folder:
   ```bash
   cd website
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173/).

**Tip:**
- The site will automatically reload as you make changes to the code.
- Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
